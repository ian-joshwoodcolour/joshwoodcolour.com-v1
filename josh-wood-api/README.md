## üñ• Developing

### Running server

To get the server up and running, simply run:

```shell
npm start
```

This will create a local server with the default port of **1337**. This relies on `.env` file that contains all required environment variables for the APIs, etc. If you need a copy from production please work with DevOps to complete this.

### Testing

Tests are currently missing. Please check back soon.


### Deploying / Publishing

Deployments are currently made manually via Deploybot. Please work with DevOps to complete this.


## üëã Contributing

Please see README of the main project for contribution guidelines.
